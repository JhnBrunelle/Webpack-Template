# Webpack-Template

### Easy webpack boilerplate so I never have to set this up again

Includes webpack and babel. This boilerplate creates a global App class, that exposes itself globally.

#### For development:
```
npm start
```

#### For production:
```
npm run-script build
```
Code is compiled to `dist`
